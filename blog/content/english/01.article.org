#+begin_quote
- Buy *a* house in *an* hour. \\
  (Even though "house" and "hour" start with the same three letters
  ("hou"), "house" attracts "a," and "hour" attracts "an.")
- *An* unknown goblin killed *a* unicorn. \\
  (Even though "unknown" and "unicorn" start with the same two letters
  ("un"), "unknown" attracts "an," and "unicorn" attracts "a." Remember
  that it is the sound of the first letter that determines whether to
  use "an" or "a.")

** PS. 关于 hotel (不用看)

hotel 之前通常是 a, 不过 h 可以不发音, 变成 an hotel.
#+begin_quote
Some speakers do not pronounce the ‘h’ at the beginning of hotel and use
‘an’ instead of ‘a’ before it. This now sounds old-fashioned.
有人说 hotel 时不发 h 音，前面用 an 而不用 a，现在听起来过时了。
