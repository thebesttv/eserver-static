* File manager

[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dolphin][Dolphin]] is my goto file manager.
Install the =dolphin= pakcage and the needed themes.
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S dolphin breeze breeze-icons
#+end_src
Also configure file previews
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S kdegraphics-thumbnailers kimageformats qt5-imageformats kdesdk-thumbnailers ffmpegthumbs taglib
#+end_src

Finally, in order to [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/qt][configure Qt 5 applications under environments other than KDE Plasma]],
install the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qt5ct-kde][qt5ct-kde]] AUR package, and use Breeze Dark as the color
theme & icon theme.

* Video playing

This section is mainly about playing videos via VLC.  The configuration
may not apply to other players such as =mpv=.

** GPU Driver

Install this for hardware acceleration:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S libva-intel-driver
#+end_src

** RTSP streaming

If an error occurs when trying to open RTSP streaming via VLC, install
=live-media=:[fn:1]
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S live-media
#+end_src
Note that =mpv= does not this to open RTSP.
