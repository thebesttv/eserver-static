* Video playing

This section is mainly about playing videos via VLC.  The configuration
may not apply to other players such as =mpv=.

** GPU Driver

Install this for hardware acceleration:
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S libva-intel-driver
#+end_src

** RTSP streaming

If an error occurs when trying to open RTSP streaming via VLC, install
=live-media=:[fn:1]
#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S live-media
#+end_src
Note that =mpv= does not this to open RTSP.
